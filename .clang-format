Language:        Cpp                    # Specifies that this format applies to C++ files only
BasedOnStyle:    Google                 # Uses Google C++ style as the base formatting style
AccessModifierOffset: -2                # Indents access specifiers (public, protected, private) 2 spaces less, aligning them with the class body
Standard:        c++20                  # Targets the C++20 standard for code compatibility
IndentWidth:     2                      # Sets the indentation width to 2 spaces
TabWidth:        2                      # Sets the width of a tab character equivalent to 2 spaces
UseTab:          Never                  # Disables tabs; uses spaces exclusively for indentation
ColumnLimit:     100                    # Sets a column limit of 100 characters per line
AlignAfterOpenBracket: Align            # Aligns parameters to the open bracket on a new line if wrapped
BinPackParameters: false                # Prevents multiple parameters from being packed into a single line; each occupies its own line
AlignEscapedNewlines: Left              # Aligns escaped newlines (e.g., `\`) to the left
AlwaysBreakTemplateDeclarations: Yes    # Forces template declarations to always break onto new lines
PackConstructorInitializers: Never      # Avoids packing multiple constructor initializers into one line; each initializer occupies its own line
BreakConstructorInitializersBeforeComma: false # Prevents line breaks before commas in constructor initializers
IndentPPDirectives: BeforeHash          # Indents preprocessor directives (#) just before the hash, aligning with the code block
SortIncludes:    Never                  # Disables sorting of `#include` directives; maintains the original include order
